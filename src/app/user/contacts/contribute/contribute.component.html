">Donate Some amount to orphans</h3>
    <div class="cardDiv">
        <P>
            In the heart of every child is a hunger for home. Not just for food and a place to sleep, but for safety and community. Most importantly: for love. At the Good Shepherd Agricultural Mission, 350kms east of Delhi in the town of Banbasa, we are much more
            than a home for unwanted Indian orphans.
        </P>
        <p>
            We are a family, where Godâ€™s love guides us all as we grow and expand year after year. Not just an Indian orphanage, we are a nearly self-sustaining organization; a working farm, a vibrant school, receiving no government assistance of any kind.
